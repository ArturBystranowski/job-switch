### Guidelines for REACT

#### REACT_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Prefer simple, declarative component code based on props and local state
- Treat props and state as immutable values (avoid in-place mutation of objects and arrays)
- Avoid using React.memo(), useCallback, and useMemo by default – rely on React Compiler optimizations instead
- Use React.memo(), useCallback, or useMemo only for well-documented performance issues or when integrating with components that are not using React Compiler
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Avoid side effects during render; use useEffect/useLayoutEffect for side effects and subscriptions
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for {{data_fetching_heavy_components}} when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive
