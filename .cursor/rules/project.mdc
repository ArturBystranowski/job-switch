# AI Rules for job-switch

1. Do not add tests unless I explicitly ask you to.
2. Do not create or modify documentation unless I explicitly ask you to.
3. Do not create additional files with examples of function usage, etc.
4. Do not run the test command after each response.
5. Do not try the build command after each response.
6. Check for current linter errors and fix them automatically.
7. For terminal operations, use PowerShell commands.
8. Write code in a way that doesn't require too many comments and explanations; use them only to describe complex functions and non-obvious scenarios.
